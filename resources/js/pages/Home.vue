                    Historical AAF season-long fantasy leagues' data has been saved. At some point this spring, I will create a tool for you to retrieve your old leagues and fondly reminisce about the good ol' AAF days.

                    XFL season-long leagues are forming now. Register or Login above to start one. If you had an account last year, you will need to create a new account. Account security was updated this summer. I will have a tool out soon to connect your new account to your old one and get all the data back.
